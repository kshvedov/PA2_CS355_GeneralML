# PA2_CS355_GeneralML
Project 2 from CS 355 some general work with the ML language

This project is from Computer Science 355, Programming Language Design. It was an assignment.
The primary idea behind this project was to learn ML but to also understand how to design
tail recursive functions versus just recursive functions. This project also incouraged to
test all cases possible. Even though a couple of the tests were provided, the bigger portion
was created by me to try to test every possible case.
