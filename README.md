# PA2_CS355_GeneralML
Project 2 from CS 355 some general work with the ML language

This project is from Computer Science 355, Programming Language Design. It was an assignment.
The primary idea behind this project was to learn ML but also to understand how to design
tail recursive functions versus just recursive functions. This project also encouraged to
test all cases possible. Even though a couple of the tests were provided, the more significant
portion was created by me to try to test every possible situation.
